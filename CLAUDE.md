# Corpus — Agent Briefing

## What This Project Is

Corpus is a web app + Chrome extension. The web app is the CV Studio. The extension is the CV Deployer.

## Repo Structure

```
/
├── CLAUDE.md
├── docs/        ← specs live here. Read the relevant one before building.
├── web/         ← web app code
└── extension/   ← chrome extension code
```

## Rules

- Read the relevant spec in docs/ before writing any code.
- Specs describe what to build and why. Implementation decisions are yours.
- Do not add features not described in the active spec.
- When in doubt about a UI decision, choose the simpler option.
- The web app and extension are separate codebases. Keep them that way.
